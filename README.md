# CIDX MCP
The AI Agent's Coding Knowledge Engine

CIDX stands for Code Index
MCP stands for Model Context Protocol 

[CIDX](https://www.cidx.dev/) CIDX MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) code index for developers, designed to enhance the capabilities of AI agents when working with code.

Our platform provides a blazing fast full-text search engine that indexes thousands of documentation links, code snippets, and architecture patterns from popular libraries and frameworks.

With context-aware search, your agent becomes sharper, more efficient, and generates clean, working code in fewer attempts.
